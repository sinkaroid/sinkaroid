I am a part time software developer mostly open-source also by the trade. I have no degree alias never go to formal [college education](https://sinkaroid.org/about), so keep in mind that if you want to hire me, I might not remember the complexity of interpolation search algorithm, but I'm good and patient in experimenting for it! 

### Don't hesitate to poke and smug me
I'm a big heart, more stress durability than anyone else, and can work under pressure.
On my profile, [PyPi](https://pypi.org/user/sinkaroid/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~sinkaroid), and [Docker](https://github.com/sinkaroid?tab=packages) You'll see some of the repositories I've made for various projects.
